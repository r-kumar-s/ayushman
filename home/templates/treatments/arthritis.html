                    <p>As per the western view, arthritis is caused due to wear and tear of the joints. Ayurveda delves deeper to unravel the root cause of arthritis, which is the imbalance in the doshas. Every individual is unique and the profile of their doshas is also unique. When unwanted substances or toxins accumulate in the body, they tend to harm the doshas. This in turn leads to various diseases, one of which is arthritis. The accumulation of toxins can occur due to various reasons such as eating cold, bitter, acidic foods; irregular meals; high level of stress and anxiety; traumatic events; frequent travelling; lack of proper sleep, use of drugs, etc. </p>
                    <p>The western view also believes that arthritis is not curable and requires surgery. Ayurveda offers a more holistic option to arthritis patients, as it focuses on providing long-term relief from pain and stiffness in the joints. Ayurvedic treatment for arthritis seeks to remove the existing toxins from the body. It also focuses on therapies and lifestyle changes that will reduce the production of toxic substances in the body. Certain Ayurvedic herbs and medicines are also used to provide relief to the patient. </p>
                    <p>Depending on the severity of the disease and the age and profile of the patient, arthritis can be effectively managed through Ayurvedic treatment. Many patients have been able to stabilize their condition whereas others have been able to reverse their arthritis. There are also patients who have achieved complete cure for their arthritis through Ayurvedic treatment. This is truly remarkable since such results are achieved without any type of surgical intervention. </p>
                    <p>Arthritis tends to aggravate with age, so the sooner you take action, the better it will be for your health and wellbeing. The initial symptoms may be mild, but you should not ignore these. Early diagnosis and Ayurvedic treatment can increase your chances of making a full recovery. Ayurveda treatment for arthritis will also ensure that you will be able to enjoy life in your old age and wonâ€™t have to become dependent on anyone. </p><br />
