          <h2>How Ayurveda Can Effectively Treat Thyroid Disorders</h2>
          <p>Thyroid disorders are caused due to over- or under-function of the Thyroid gland, which is an endocrine gland located in front of the neck. Thyroid problems have become widespread in India, with a recent report showing that nearly 1 in every 3 Indian is experiencing some type of Thyroid problem. The report also reveals that cases of Hypothyroidism (under-functioning Thyroid) are more prevalent in North India, whereas the South and West India have more cases of Hyperthyroidism (Over-functioning Thyroid). Thyroid disorders can affect the quality of life with debilitating symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, depression, weight gain, heart palpitations, recurrent infections, breathing problems, menstrual disturbance, etc. </p>
          <p>For people diagnosed with Thyroid problems, Ayurveda comes across as an effective treatment option. Ayurveda therapies for Thyroid problems are effective because they target the root cause of the disorder and provide long-lasting relief. Thyroid problems can also be treated with allopathic medicines, but these only provide temporary relief and may also have side effects. In comparison, Ayurveda treatments are based on thousands of years of knowledge and wisdom, and do not have any side effects. </p><br />
          <h5>Here are some of the Ayurveda therapies that can effectively treat Thyroid problems.</h5>
