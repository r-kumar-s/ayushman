            <p data-aos="fade-right">A tumor is any abnormal mass of tissue that is either solid or is filled with fluid. Tumors can occur both outside and inside the body, and can vary in size. A tumor can be a small lump, the size of a pinhead or it can be as large as a watermelon weighing several kilograms. Tumors are caused by abnormal growth of rogue cells and they can develop in any part of the body – brain, stomach, chest, abdomen, legs, face, hands, etc.</p>

          <p>Tumors can also be classified according to the level of health risk they pose for the patient. In this context, tumors are classified as benign, premalignant and malignant. Benign tumors are those that are not cancerous and can be easily removed. Premalignant tumors are not yet cancerous, but they are seen to be taking on the properties of cancerous tumors. Malignant tumors are the ones that are cancerous and these are the most difficult to treat.</p>
          <p>As per Ayurveda, any type of disease is caused due to the imbalance of the Vata, Pitta and Kapha doshas. These are affected by various factors such as sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy diet, stress, anxiety, pollution, etc. The type of Ayurvedic treatment for a tumor will depend on the type and location of the tumor. An assessment will also be made regarding whether the tumor is benign, premalignant or malignant. Some of the most commonly occurring benign tumors are Adenomas, Fibroids or fibromas, Hemangiomas, and Lipomas. In case of premalignant tumors, they can be diagnosed as actinic keratosis, cervical dysplasia, Metaplasia of the lung, and Leukoplakia. Malignant tumors include Carcinoma, Sarcoma, Germ cell tumor, and Blastoma.</p>
          <p>The success of Ayurvedic treatment will depend on the type of tumor. Ayurveda seeks to restore the balance of the doshas, so that the tumor does not reoccur. Treatment will include Ayurveda therapies, Ayurveda herbs &amp; medicines and lifestyle changes. Ayurveda therapies can also be beneficial in specific cases where it is not possible to surgically remove the tumor. For example, certain types of brain tumor cannot be removed surgically since there’s a high risk of causing permanent brain damage. In such cases, Ayurvedic treatment can provide relief from symptoms and improve the quality of life of the patient. </p>
          <p>It’s very difficult to differentiate between cancerous and non-cancerous tumors. If you notice any lump or abnormal growth in your body, you should immediately consult an Ayurveda doctor. Even cancerous tumors can be treated if diagnosed early, so make sure you don’t delay in reporting the matter to the doctor. Ayurvedic treatment for tumors is based on a holistic approach, offers long-term health benefits, and does not have any side-effects. </p><br />
