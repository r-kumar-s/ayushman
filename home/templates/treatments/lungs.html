                    <h2>How Ayurveda Can Effectively Treat Lungs Disorders</h2>
                    <p>Ayurveda treatments for lung diseases focus on eliminating the root cause of the disease, which ensures effective and long-term relief. As per Ayurveda, most diseases are caused due to imbalance of the doshas, Vata, Pitta &amp; Kapha, which are present in each individual in varying proportions. When external factors such as pollution, stress, unhealthy food, etc. interact with the doshas, they create imbalance in the body, leading to diseases. Ayurveda identifies the imbalance of the doshas as the root cause of diseases and focuses on restoring the balance through various therapies and herbal medications. </p>
                    <p>Most types of lung diseases reduce the amount of oxygen entering the body. Oxygen is the vital element that our body needs every second and deficiency in the same leads to various diseases. Oxygen flow can be interrupted due to various factors and one of the most common reasons is a blocked nasal passage. This can be due to allergic reactions, viral infections, or the presence of pollutants inside the nasal passage. In such cases, the Ayurveda treatment of Nasyakarma is administered to unclog the nasal passage. Lack of adequate oxygen can also be due to underperforming lung tissues. In such cases, the treatment of Shirodhara and Ayurveda massage has shown to provide long-lasting relief. </p>
                    <p>In addition to boosting oxygen supply, Ayurveda treatments also strengthen the immune system. This reduces the risk of contracting infectious lung diseases such as Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), etc. Ayurveda treatments are also proven to remove toxins from the body and eliminate stress and anxiety, which in turn enhance the healing power of the human body. </p>
                    <p>If you are experiencing symptoms of lung diseases such as shortness of breath, chronic cough, wheezing, chest pain, and excess mucus production, it’s advisable that you consult a registered Ayurveda practitioner immediately. Don’t ignore the symptoms even if they are mild since the underlying disease can escalate and result in other medical complications. Ayurveda therapies are very effective in treating a wide variety of lung diseases. So, the sooner you start, the better it will be for your health. </p>
                    <p> <b>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</b> - This is a type of interstitial lung disease, which is progressive in form and is highly chronic in nature. The causes of the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are yet to be known. The interstitium is mainly affected in this case.</p><br />
