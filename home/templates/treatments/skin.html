                        <p data-aos="fade-right">The skin covers our entire body and provides the first layer of defense against pollutants and harmful pathogens. Skin is considered an organ, just like our liver, kidneys, heart, etc., and it is the biggest organ in the human body. With such a crucial role to play in the human body, it is important to take proper care of the skin. A healthy skin is not only great to look at externally, but it also acts as an effective barrier against foreign matter and microorganisms. A radiant skin is also a reflection of good health, which is why itâ€™s important to nourish the skin from the inside.</p>

                    <p>Being the largest organ in the human body and being continuously exposed to the elements such as UV Rays, pollutants, bacteria, viruses, fungus, allergens, etc., skin becomes susceptible to a range of skin disorders. An individual's lifestyle and food choices also determine the type of skin one has and the risk of skin disorders. For example, if a person is experiencing heightened stress and anxiety, it can work as a contributory factor for skin diseases. In the same manner, dependence on junk food can also increase the risk of skin disorders. There are various types of skin disorders such as Itching (Pruritus), Eczema, Psoriasis, Ringworm, Vitiligo (Leucoderma), Abscess, Black/White Pigmentation, Urticaria (hives), Acne/Pimples, etc.</p>
                    <p>To treat skin disorders, Ayurveda focuses on eliminating the root cause of the disease. The imbalance in the doshas caused due to stressful lifestyles and unhealthy food choices is a major contributor to skin disorders. In most cases, skin disorders are caused by the aggravation of the pitta dosha (heat element). An increasing number of cases of skin disorders are detected during the rainy season, since this is the time when the imbalance in the pitta dosha is at its maximum level. The sudden transition from summer to rainy season aggravates the pitta dosha, resulting in various types of skin diseases. It is also important to note that certain skin disorders occur more in a specific season due to the aggravation of contributory factors. </p>
                    <p>Since the condition of your skin reflects your overall health, you should never ignore any type of skin problems you may face. For example, dry, itchy skin could be indicative of more serious problems such as diabetes. Similarly, if your skin has become prone to infections, it could point to a weak digestive system or deficiency of key vitamins and minerals. </p>
                    <p>Ayurvedic treatment for skin disorders involves a mix of Ayurveda therapies, Ayurveda herbs &amp; medicines and lifestyle changes. Ayurveda has a high success rate and provides complete cure by eliminating the root cause of the skin disorder. </p>
